RULES = """Module contract (violations are rejected by a static validator):
- Return ONLY JavaScript. One export: `export default function generate(THREE) { ... return root; }`, synchronous.
- THREE exists only as that parameter. Helpers that need it take a parameter named exactly `THREE`. Never alias THREE, never `THREE[expr]`, never reference THREE at top level.
- Forbidden anywhere, even as local variable names: import, require, Math.random, Date, performance, fetch, XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, window, document, navigator, self, global, globalThis, module, process, eval, Function, setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, queueMicrotask, crypto, Proxy, Reflect, WeakRef, Worker, localStorage.
- Allowed THREE members: Group, Object3D, Mesh, InstancedMesh, Line, LineSegments, Points; BufferGeometry, BufferAttribute, Float32BufferAttribute, Uint16BufferAttribute, Uint32BufferAttribute; BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, CylinderGeometry, CapsuleGeometry, ConeGeometry, TorusGeometry, TorusKnotGeometry, PlaneGeometry, CircleGeometry, RingGeometry, TetrahedronGeometry, OctahedronGeometry, DodecahedronGeometry, IcosahedronGeometry, PolyhedronGeometry, ExtrudeGeometry, LatheGeometry, ShapeGeometry, TubeGeometry, EdgesGeometry; MeshStandardMaterial, MeshPhysicalMaterial, MeshBasicMaterial, LineBasicMaterial, PointsMaterial; DataTexture (procedural data only; geometry needs uv); Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix3, Matrix4, Quaternion, Euler, Box3, Sphere, Color, MathUtils (not seededRandom/generateUUID); Shape, Path, Curve, CurvePath, CatmullRomCurve3, CubicBezierCurve3, QuadraticBezierCurve3, LineCurve3, EllipseCurve, ArcCurve, SplineCurve; constants such as DoubleSide, FrontSide, SRGBColorSpace, RepeatWrapping, RGBAFormat, UnsignedByteType, LinearFilter, NearestFilter.
- Forbidden THREE APIs: loaders, ShaderMaterial, RawShaderMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, MeshPhongMaterial, CanvasTexture, morph targets, animation.
- Limits: <=200 draw calls (meshes), <=250,000 vertices, <=50,000 instances, scene depth <=32, <=4 MiB of texture data in total (one 1024x1024 RGBA DataTexture is already 4 MiB; use 256x256 or 512x512), <=50 KB of string+numeric literals, <=5 s, deterministic (no randomness; derive variation from indices with sin/cos hashes).
- Practical budget: the software renderer times out on heavy scenes, so stay under about 60,000 vertices, 120 meshes and 5,000 instances. Make each DataTexture at most 512x512, create it once and reuse it, and use at most 6. Spend detail where the cameras see it.
- Never put a unary minus or plus directly before `**` (`-x ** 2` is a syntax error); write `-(x ** 2)`.
- Y is up. Build at natural scale; the result is re-centered and scaled into [-0.5, 0.5] automatically."""

JUDGING = """How the result is judged: the module is rendered on a white background (and a mid-gray one) by a camera on the +Z side looking at the origin: from 30 degrees to the right (+X) of +Z, 30 degrees to the left, from about 30 degrees above, and slightly from below; plus the right, back, left and top views. The camera is perspective with a 49.1 degree field of view at 2.0 units from the origin. A vision-language model compares each render with the reference photo and prefers the model that looks more like the same object: overall shape and proportions, colors and materials, distinctive parts and their counts, and a complete, plausible object from every side. It penalises missing or extra parts, floating parts, wrong colors, washed-out or blackened materials, and anything that is not the object (floors, pedestals, boxes, frames).
Pose: place the object so that the camera on +Z, slightly above, sees it the way the photo shows it (same side facing the viewer, same upright/lying/profile pose and left-right direction). Do not canonicalise it: an object that lies, leans or runs diagonally in the photo keeps that lie, lean or diagonal in the X-Y plane. A long object photographed from the side (boat, car, train, shoe, sandal, knife, pen, animal in profile) runs along X, never toward the camera. Objects photographed face-on or lying flat (boards, plates, trays, coins, clocks, signs, cards, book covers) present that face toward +Z, so the front views see the face and not a thin edge. This rule overrides any other "+Z forward" convention. Model only the object itself, never the floor, background, shadows or reflections."""

CRAFT = """Craft:
- Decompose the object into its real parts. Get the silhouette and proportions right first, then add the distinctive details (bevels, rims, seams, handles, holes, rivets, markings) and reproduce the exact count of every repeated part. Where the photo shows a label, logo or printed pattern, paint it as a simple DataTexture in the right colours and place it on the right face.
- Use LatheGeometry for round profiles, ExtrudeGeometry (with bevel) for flat shapes with outlines, TubeGeometry for bent rods/cables/handles, smooth sphere/capsule segments for organic forms; scale spheres non-uniformly for ellipsoids.
- Use MeshStandardMaterial/MeshPhysicalMaterial with the photo's actual colors (hex), sensible roughness, metalness only for metal and at most 0.6 (higher renders black under the judge's light; carry the metal shade in the colour, e.g. silver #b8b8b8, metalness 0.5, roughness 0.3). MeshBasicMaterial only for small glowing parts. Match the photo's hue and saturation: do not lighten, grey out or darken colours. Avoid pure white (use at most about #e6e6e6, it vanishes on the white background) and pure black (use #1c1c1c to #2a2a2a). Use small procedural DataTextures for visible patterns (wood grain, fabric, rust, print) when they matter. Keep parts opaque unless the photo shows them transparent. Glass/clear plastic: transparent: true with opacity 0.35-0.6, a visible tint and visible edges or rims (do not use transmission; it renders very slowly).
- Keep surfaces closed; avoid thin floating planes, z-fighting and parts poking through each other.
- Wheels turn with their axle: for a vehicle shown from the side (length along X, axles along Z) tyres keep the default TorusGeometry orientation and CylinderGeometry hubs need rotation.x = Math.PI / 2; for a vehicle facing +Z (axles along X) tyres need rotation.y = Math.PI / 2 and hubs rotation.z = Math.PI / 2."""
